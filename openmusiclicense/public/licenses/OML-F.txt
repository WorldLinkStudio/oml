FREE LICENSE

Version 1.0 - Effective October 2025
===============================================================================

OVERVIEW

This is a fully open source license for music. You can use, modify, sell, and 
distribute this work freely with no restrictions or revenue limits. You only 
need to provide attribution to the creator and include this license with any 
distribution.

This license is inspired by open source software licenses and is designed for 
creators who want their music to be as open and accessible as possible.

===============================================================================

1. DEFINITIONS

"Work" means the musical composition, beat, instrumental, sound recording, 
audio sample, loop, stem, or other music asset covered by this license, 
including all component elements and individual tracks.

"Creator" means the person or entity that created the Work.

"You" means any person or entity using the Work under this license.

"Derivative Work" means any musical composition, recording, or production that 
incorporates, transforms, modifies, samples, or is based upon the Work.

"Distribution" means making the Work or Derivative Works available to others, 
whether for free or for sale.

===============================================================================

2. WHAT YOU CAN DO

You can do ANYTHING with this work, including:

• Use the Work in any project (personal, commercial, nonprofit)
• Modify the Work in any way
• Create Derivative Works and remixes
• Sell the Work or Derivative Works
• Distribute the Work or Derivative Works (free or paid)

• Use in advertising, film, TV, video games, and all media
• Release on any platform or format
• Grant others rights to use the Work

There are NO restrictions on how you can use, modify, or profit from this Work.

===============================================================================

3. YOUR ONLY REQUIREMENTS

You must do TWO things:

REQUIREMENT 1: ATTRIBUTION
Provide clear credit to the Creator in an accessible location:

• Audio file metadata (Producer, Composer, or Comment fields)
• Video description or credits
• Track credits on streaming platforms
• Album liner notes or digital booklet
• Social media posts or captions
• Website credits page
• Product documentation
• Any other place where credits are reasonably provided

Minimum attribution format:
"[Work Title] by [Creator Name]" or "prod. by [Creator Name]" or "Original 
music by [Creator Name]"

REQUIREMENT 2: INCLUDE LICENSE
When you distribute the Work or Derivative Works, you must:

• Include a copy of this OML-F license, OR
• Include a link to this license, OR
• Include a notice stating "Licensed under OML-F 1.0" with a link to where 
  the license can be found

This ensures anyone receiving the Work knows their rights under this license.

That's it. No revenue limits. No approval requirements. No restrictions on use.

===============================================================================

4. WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH STEMS AND SAMPLES

Unlike other OML licenses, OML-F grants you full access to everything:

• Extract individual stems, tracks, and elements
• Use samples and sounds from the Work in other projects
• Redistribute stems and isolated elements
• Create sample packs using sounds from the Work
• Build upon individual components however you choose

The only requirements remain: attribution and license inclusion.

If the Creator provides stems, individual tracks, or isolated elements, you can 
use them freely. If stems aren't provided but you want them, contact the 
Creator to request them.

===============================================================================

5. YOUR DERIVATIVE WORKS

When you create something using the Work:

• You own your original creative contributions
• The original Work remains under OML-F
• Your Derivative Work can be licensed however you choose (but the original 
  Work portions remain OML-F)
• You must still provide attribution to the original Creator
• You must include the OML-F license with any distribution

You can:
• Release Derivative Works commercially
• License Derivative Works under different terms for your contributions
• Sell beats, songs, or products incorporating the Work
• Grant exclusive rights to your Derivative Works (but not to the underlying 
  OML-F Work)

Attribution examples for Derivative Works:
"Contains music by Radio Tom (OML-F)" or "Based on [Work Title] by Radio Tom" 
or "Sample from [Work Title] by Radio Tom - Licensed under OML-F"

===============================================================================

6. REDISTRIBUTION RULES

You can redistribute the Work or Derivative Works freely, but you must:

• Keep all copyright notices and attribution information intact
• Include a copy of this license or a link to it
• Clearly indicate if you made modifications to the original Work
• Not add additional restrictions that limit what recipients can do under 
  OML-F

If you distribute just the original Work (unmodified or modified), it must 
remain under OML-F. If you create a Derivative Work, you can license your new 
contributions separately, but the OML-F portions stay OML-F.

Examples:

Scenario 1: You remix the beat
• Original beat remains OML-F
• Your new elements (melody you added, vocals, etc.) can be under any license
• Must credit original Creator and include OML-F license for the beat portion

Scenario 2: You create a sample pack using sounds from the Work
• Samples derived from OML-F Work remain OML-F
• Must credit Creator and include OML-F license with sample pack
• Your sample pack can be sold - just include proper attribution and license

Scenario 3: You distribute the unmodified Work
• Must include complete OML-F license
• Must keep Creator's attribution intact
• Can charge for distribution (hosting, physical media, etc.)

===============================================================================

7. SUBLICENSING AND THIRD PARTIES

You can grant others rights to use the Work or Derivative Works:

• Sublicenses are permitted
• You can license Derivative Works to others commercially
• Recipients receive the same OML-F rights to the original Work portions
• You cannot remove or restrict the OML-F freedoms for the original Work

Example: You create a beat using OML-F samples and sell it to an artist
• Artist gets full OML-F rights to the original samples/elements
• You can negotiate separate terms for your creative contributions
• Artist must credit original Creator and include OML-F license
• Artist can then create and sell their own song using your beat

===============================================================================

• Metadata - Producer: "Radio Tom" + Comment: "Licensed under OML-F 1.0"

===============================================================================

9. NO WARRANTY

THE WORK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, 
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.

The Creator makes no guarantees about:
• Quality, accuracy, or suitability of the Work
• Absence of third-party claims or infringement issues
• Compatibility with your systems or workflows
• Continued availability or support

YOU USE THE WORK AT YOUR OWN RISK.

===============================================================================

10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE CREATOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR 
ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM USE OF THE WORK, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:
• Direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages
• Loss of profits, revenue, data, or business
• Cost of substitute goods or services
• Any other losses or damages of any kind

This applies even if the Creator was advised of the possibility of such damages.

Some jurisdictions don't allow exclusion of liability, so these limitations may 
not fully apply to you.

===============================================================================

11. PATENT AND TRADEMARK NOTICE

This license does not grant you any rights to:
• Use the Creator's name, trademarks, or logos for endorsement or advertising 
  without written permission
• Any patents the Creator may hold
• Imply Creator endorsement of your products or Derivative Works

You can credit the Creator as required, but cannot use their name or brand for 
marketing beyond factual attribution.

===============================================================================

12. TERMINATION

This license is perpetual and cannot be revoked by the Creator.

However, YOUR rights terminate automatically if you fail to:
• Provide proper attribution, OR
• Include the license with distributions, OR  
• Preserve copyright notices in the Work

If your rights terminate:
• Stop distributing the Work or Derivative Works
• Remove the Work from products and services under your control
• You have 30 days to cure attribution or license inclusion violations
• If cured within 30 days, your rights are automatically restored
• This cure option is available once per violation type

Sections 9 (No Warranty) and 10 (Limitation of Liability) survive any 
termination.

===============================================================================

13. COMPATIBILITY WITH SAMPLE LIBRARIES

Important Note:

If the Creator used samples from commercial libraries (Splice, Loopcloud, etc.) 
to create this Work, those underlying samples remain subject to their original 
licenses.

The Creator can only grant OML-F rights to:
• Elements they created entirely themselves
• Samples and sounds they have rights to distribute openly
• Their own arrangements, compositions, and creative contributions

If the Creator used commercial samples with restrictive licenses, they should 
clearly disclose this, and those restrictions may limit what you can do with 
isolated elements.

Best practice: Ask the Creator if the Work contains any restricted samples 
before extracting and redistributing individual elements.

For Works created entirely from scratch or using other OML-F or public domain 
materials, you have complete freedom with all elements.

===============================================================================

14. COPYLEFT OPTION (OPTIONAL)

Some Creators may want a "copyleft" approach where Derivative Works must also 
be OML-F. This is OPTIONAL and must be clearly stated by the Creator:

Standard OML-F (default):
• Your Derivative Works can be under any license you choose
• Only the original OML-F portions remain OML-F

OML-F with Copyleft (if Creator specifies):
• Derivative Works must also be licensed under OML-F
• This ensures the Work and all derivatives remain free and open
• Similar to GPL in software

The Creator must explicitly state if they're using the copyleft option. If not 
specified, assume standard OML-F (no copyleft requirement).

===============================================================================

15. GENERAL PROVISIONS

Entire Agreement: This license is the complete agreement regarding the Work.

Governing Law: This license is governed by the laws of the Creator's 
jurisdiction.

Severability: If any provision is invalid, the rest remains in effect.

No Waiver: Failure to enforce any term doesn't waive the right to enforce it 
later.

Assignment: You can transfer your rights under this license. The Creator can 
assign their rights with notice.

Acceptance: By using, modifying, or distributing the Work, you accept these 
terms.

Language: If this license is translated, the English version controls in case 
of conflicts.

Updates: The Creator may release updated versions of OML-F. You can choose to 
use the Work under the original version or any later version.

===============================================================================

16. WHY OML-F?

This license exists for creators who believe in:

• Maximum creative freedom
• Open collaboration and sharing
• Building upon others' work
• Removing barriers to creativity
• Free and open culture
• Community over commercialization (while still allowing commercial use)

OML-F is for music what MIT and Apache licenses are for software - truly open, 
truly free, with minimal restrictions.

If you want more control or compensation, consider:
• OML-P (free under $1K, then requires commercial license)
• OML-C (commercial license with negotiated payment)
• OML-S (sync license for audiovisual productions)

OML-F is the most permissive option - use it when you want your music to be as 
accessible and reusable as possible.

===============================================================================

17. LICENSE NOTICE

When distributing the Work or Derivative Works, include this notice:

"This work contains music licensed under the Open Music License - Free (OML-F). 
Creator: [Name]. You are free to use, modify, and distribute this work with 
attribution. Full license: [URL or included file]"
