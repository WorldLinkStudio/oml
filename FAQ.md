## General Questions

### What is OML?

OML (Open Music License) is a dual-tier licensing framework designed specifically for music producers, beatmakers, and audio creators. It provides a fair, transparent, and enforceable way to license music for both personal and commercial use.

### How is OML different from other music licenses?

Unlike traditional music licenses or Creative Commons, OML:

- Has a clear revenue threshold ($1,000/year for personal use)
- Provides specific attribution requirements
- Offers flexible payment structures for commercial use
- Includes music-specific provisions for sampling, stems, and derivatives
- Has built-in upgrade paths from personal to commercial licensing

### What are the three types of OML licenses?

- **OML-P (Personal)**: Free for personal projects under $1,000/year revenue
- **OML-C (Commercial)**: Paid licensing for professional/commercial use
- **OML-S (Sync)**: Special licensing for film, TV, video, and synchronization uses

### Who created OML?

OML was developed through collaborative research incorporating principles from Creative Commons, OSI-approved licenses, and music industry best practices. It's designed to balance open collaboration with fair creator compensation.

### Is OML legally binding?

Yes, OML is designed to be legally enforceable. It uses professional legal language and includes dispute resolution mechanisms. However, as with any legal document, you should consult with an attorney for specific legal advice.

## OML-P (Personal Use) Questions

### What can I do with OML-P?

With OML-P, you can:

- Use the music in your creative projects
- Modify and create derivative works
- Distribute your projects (with proper attribution)
- Perform the music publicly
- Make money up to $1,000/year total revenue

### What counts toward the $1,000 revenue threshold?

All income from projects using the music counts, including:

- Advertising revenue (YouTube, podcasts, websites)
- Sponsorships and partnerships
- Direct sales (merchandise, tickets)
- Streaming royalties
- Crowdfunding (Patreon, Ko-fi)
- Affiliate income
- Licensing fees you receive
- Donations and tips

### How is the $1,000 threshold calculated?

- It's a rolling 12-month period (not calendar year)
- Includes ALL projects using the music
- Calculated in USD (other currencies converted using XE.com rates)
- Cumulative total from all revenue sources

### What happens if I exceed $1,000?

You have a 30-day grace period to obtain a Commercial Use License (OML-C). During this period, you can continue using the music while negotiating commercial terms. After 30 days, you must either get a commercial license or stop using the music.

### Can I use OML-P for multiple projects?

Yes, but the $1,000 threshold applies to ALL projects combined. If you use the same music in multiple projects, the revenue from all projects counts toward the threshold.

### Do I need to track my revenue?

Yes, you must accurately track and maintain records of all revenue from projects using the music. This protects both you and the creator.

### Can I sell the music files themselves?

No, you cannot sell, rent, lease, or transfer the music files as standalone products. You can only use them as part of your creative projects.

## OML-C (Commercial Use) Questions

### When do I need OML-C?

You need OML-C when:

- Your revenue exceeds $1,000/year
- You want unlimited commercial use without revenue tracking
- You need to sublicense derivative works
- You want professional warranties and protections
- You need exclusive rights

### What payment options are available?

OML-C offers three payment structures:

- **Percentage-based**: Pay 2-10% of your revenue depending on use type
- **Flat fee**: Pay once upfront ($500-$100,000+ depending on scope)
- **Hybrid**: Pay upfront fee + reduced ongoing royalties

### How do percentage-based royalties work?

You pay a percentage of your net revenue:

- Featured use (main focus): 5-8%
- Background use: 2-3%
- Video games: 2.5-6%
- NFTs: 10% of gross revenue
- Sublicensing: 25% of sublicensing revenue

### What's the difference between gross and net revenue?

- **Gross Revenue**: Total income before any deductions
- **Net Revenue**: Gross revenue minus reasonable, documented costs directly related to distribution (platform fees, payment processing, etc.)

### How often do I need to report and pay?

For percentage-based licenses:

- Quarterly reports due within 30 days of each quarter end
- Payment due simultaneously with report submission
- Minimum payment threshold: $50/quarter

### What if I can't pay the minimum threshold?

If your calculated royalty is below $50/quarter, no payment is due. Unpaid amounts below threshold don't carry forward to future periods.

### Can I negotiate different terms?

Yes, OML-C terms are negotiable. You can discuss custom royalty rates, payment schedules, exclusivity terms, and other provisions with the creator.

### What happens if I don't pay royalties?

Late payments incur a 1.5% monthly late fee. If you fail to pay after 60 days, the creator can terminate your license.

## OML-S (Sync) Questions

### What is OML-S used for?

OML-S is specifically for synchronization licensing - putting music in videos, films, TV shows, advertisements, video games, and other audiovisual content.

### What rights does OML-S cover?

OML-S covers both:

- **Master Use Rights**: Right to use the specific sound recording
- **Synchronization Rights**: Right to use the underlying musical composition

### How is OML-S different from OML-C?

- OML-S is project-specific (each project needs a separate license)
- OML-S covers sync rights specifically
- OML-S has detailed terms for territory, media, and duration
- OML-S includes professional delivery requirements

### What are typical OML-S fees?

Fees vary widely based on project scope:

- Independent film: $1,000-$10,000
- Major studio film: $10,000-$100,000+
- TV episode: $1,500-$10,000
- National advertising: $15,000-$150,000
- Video games: $2,000-$50,000+

### Can I modify the music for sync use?

Yes, but with limitations:

- **Permitted**: Editing for time, fade in/out, volume adjustments, technical conversions
- **Prohibited**: Changes to melody/harmony, pitch shifting, adding new elements, remixing

### What if I need the music longer than originally licensed?

You'll need to negotiate a license extension or renewal. The original license terms don't automatically extend.

### Do I need separate licenses for different territories?

Yes, unless your license specifically includes worldwide rights. Distribution outside the licensed territory requires a new license or amendment.

## Attribution Questions

### What attribution is required?

All OML licenses require attribution including:

- Creator's name
- Title of the work
- Copyright notice
- License information
- Creator's contact information (when feasible)

### Where do I put attribution?

Attribution must be "reasonably accessible to the audience experiencing your project":

- Video descriptions and end credits
- Album liner notes
- Streaming platform credits
- Website credits pages
- Social media captions
- Live performance announcements

### Can I abbreviate the attribution?

You can abbreviate the license name (e.g., "OML-P" after first full mention), but you cannot abbreviate the creator's name or remove required elements.

### What if I forget to include attribution?

You have a 15-day cure period to add proper attribution. If you fix it within 15 days, your license is automatically reinstated.

### Can I translate attribution to another language?

Yes, but you must include both the translated version and the original language version.

### Do I need attribution for derivative works?

Yes, derivative works must clearly indicate they contain or are based on the original work, plus include complete attribution to the creator.

## Revenue and Payment Questions

### How do I track revenue?

Keep detailed records of all income sources:

- Use accounting software or spreadsheets
- Save receipts and payment confirmations
- Calculate monthly to stay on top of thresholds
- Be honest and comprehensive

### What if I'm not sure if something counts as revenue?

When in doubt, include it in your tracking. It's better to over-report than under-report.

### How do I convert foreign currency to USD?

Use XE.com exchange rates on the date revenue was received, or equivalent service.

### Can I deduct expenses from revenue?

For OML-P: No, use gross revenue
For OML-C: Yes, you can deduct reasonable, documented costs directly related to distribution (platform fees, payment processing, etc.)

### What payment methods are accepted?

Common methods include:

- Bank transfer/wire transfer
- PayPal
- Check (for domestic payments)
- Cryptocurrency (if mutually agreed)

### What if the creator doesn't respond to payment requests?

Try multiple contact methods and be patient. Document your attempts to contact them. If urgent, consider using different music.

## Technical Questions

### What audio formats are supported?

OML works with any audio format, but creators typically provide:

- WAV 24-bit/44.1kHz or 48kHz
- AIFF
- MP3 320kbps
- FLAC

### How do I embed attribution in audio files?

Use metadata editing tools:

- **MP3**: ID3v2 tags
- **FLAC/OGG**: Vorbis Comments
- **WAV**: BWF metadata
- **Tools**: ffmpeg, Audacity, iTunes, etc.

### Can I use OML music in video games?

Yes, but you may need OML-S (Sync) licensing depending on how the music is used. Contact the creator to determine the appropriate license.

### Can I use OML music for AI training?

No, use of OML-licensed music for AI training requires separate written permission and is not authorized under any OML license without explicit consent.

### What about streaming platforms?

For distribution on streaming platforms, you may need to:

- Register with PROs (ASCAP, BMI, SESAC)
- Submit proper metadata
- Ensure creator gets songwriter credits
- Follow platform-specific requirements

## Legal Questions

### Is OML enforceable in court?

OML is designed to be legally enforceable and includes dispute resolution mechanisms. However, legal enforcement depends on jurisdiction and specific circumstances.

### What if there's a dispute?

OML includes a three-step dispute resolution process:

1. **Negotiation**: 30 days of good-faith negotiation
2. **Mediation**: Non-binding mediation if negotiation fails
3. **Arbitration**: Binding arbitration as final step

### Can I get legal advice about OML?

Yes, you should consult with an entertainment attorney familiar with music licensing for specific legal advice about your situation.

### What if the creator doesn't own the rights?

Creators warrant that they own the rights they're licensing. If there's a dispute about ownership, the creator is responsible for resolving it and indemnifying you against claims.

### Can I assign my OML license to someone else?

- **OML-P**: No, personal licenses are non-transferable
- **OML-C**: Only with creator's written consent
- **OML-S**: Only with creator's written consent

### What if I violate the license terms?

Your license terminates automatically upon violation. You have cure periods for certain violations (15 days for attribution, 30 days for revenue threshold).

### Does OML cover performance rights?

OML covers the rights granted in the license. Performance rights collected by PROs (ASCAP, BMI, SESAC) are separate and typically retained by the creator.

### Can I use OML music in countries with different copyright laws?

OML is designed to work internationally, but you should ensure compliance with local copyright laws in your jurisdiction.
