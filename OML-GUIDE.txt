OPEN MUSIC LICENSE (OML) v1.0
QUICK REFERENCE GUIDE
===============================================================================

OVERVIEW

The OML framework provides four simple, practical licenses for modern music 
creators. All licenses are compatible with using sample libraries like Splice, 
Loopcloud, etc. in your productions (except OML-F which is fully open source).

===============================================================================

THE FOUR LICENSES

OML-F (FREE/OPEN SOURCE)
• Completely FREE with no revenue limits
• Truly open source - modify, sell, redistribute freely
• Can extract and use stems/samples
• Only requires attribution and license inclusion
• Most permissive option for maximum sharing

OML-P (PERSONAL USE)
• FREE for projects under $1,000/year revenue
• Requires attribution to creator
• Can monetize on streaming, YouTube, social media, etc.
• Works for beats, songs, samples, loops - everything
• Must upgrade to OML-C when you exceed $1,000

OML-C (COMMERCIAL USE)  
• For unlimited commercial revenue
• Required when revenue exceeds $1,000/year
• Payment structure negotiated between creator and user
• Options: percentage royalty, flat fee, or hybrid
• All commercial uses permitted

OML-S (SYNC LICENSE)
• Specifically for visual media (film, TV, ads, video games, etc.)
• Flat fee structure based on project scope
• Covers both master and sync rights in one agreement
• Specify term, territory, media, and usage details
• File cue sheets with PROs for performance royalties

===============================================================================

KEY IMPROVEMENTS IN v1.0

SIMPLIFIED STRUCTURE
• Removed complex legal jargon
• Focused on practical, real-world usage
• Clear "can do" and "cannot do" sections
• Easier to understand and implement

COMPATIBLE WITH SAMPLE LIBRARIES
• Can use Splice, Loopcloud, etc. in your productions
• Clear distinction between rights to the finished work vs. underlying samples
• Respects original sample library licenses
• No conflict with third-party terms

NO LICENSE IN TITLE REQUIRED
• License reference just needs to be somewhere accessible
• Can be in metadata, description, credits, documentation
• Doesn't clutter titles or interfere with creativity
• Makes compliance easier

NEGOTIATED PRICING
• OML-C: negotiate royalty rate or flat fee based on use case
• OML-S: negotiate sync fee based on project budget and scope
• No rigid price ranges - flexibility for both parties
• Real-world approach to compensation

INCLUSIVE FOR ALL MUSIC TYPES
• Works for beats, songs, instrumentals, samples, loops
• No separate "beat license" needed
• OML-P covers everything under the revenue threshold
• One framework for all music production assets
• OML-F provides truly open source option for maximum sharing

===============================================================================

WHEN TO USE EACH LICENSE

USE OML-F IF:
• You want your music to be completely open source
• You believe in maximum creative freedom and sharing
• You want others to freely extract, remix, and redistribute your work
• You don't need revenue from the music itself
• You want to build a community around your work
• You support open culture and collaborative creativity
• You want your music used as widely as possible without barriers
• Users can do anything - including selling, modifying, and redistributing

USE OML-P IF:
• You're a creator offering your music/beats for free with attribution
• Users can monetize but revenue stays under $1,000/year
• You want to support emerging artists and small creators
• You want your music accessible while reserving commercial rights
• Users include hobbyists, students, small YouTubers, indie artists

USE OML-C IF:
• Your music/beats will be used in projects earning over $1,000/year
• You want to negotiate compensation for commercial use
• User needs unlimited commercial rights from the start
• You want ongoing royalties or upfront flat fee
• Users include professional artists, labels, brands, businesses

USE OML-S IF:
• Your music will be synced with visual media
• User is making film, TV show, advertisement, video game, etc.
• You want project-specific licensing with defined scope
• You want to specify exactly how/where music can be used
• You'll receive PRO performance royalties in addition to sync fee

===============================================================================

USING SPLICE AND SAMPLE LIBRARIES

IMPORTANT: All OML licenses are compatible with using Splice and other sample 
libraries in your productions.

HOW IT WORKS:

When you create a beat using Splice samples:
1. You have rights to the beat you created (your original composition)
2. You can license that beat under OML-P or OML-C
3. Users get rights to use your beat as a finished work
4. Users DON'T get rights to extract and redistribute the underlying Splice 
   samples
5. This respects both OML and Splice's terms

What users CAN do:
• Use your beat in their songs/videos/projects
• Monetize their content using your beat
• Create derivative works based on your beat
• Get proper credit and licensing

What users CANNOT do:
• Extract individual samples from your beat to use separately
• Redistribute stems or isolated elements as standalone files
• Sublicense the underlying samples to others
• Claim the samples as their own

WHY THIS WORKS:

Copyright in music is layered - you own your arrangement and composition even 
when using licensed samples. You're granting rights to your creative work 
(the beat as a complete composition), not to the underlying samples.

This is exactly how it works with traditional beat licensing and sample 
libraries - standard practice in the industry.

===============================================================================

ATTRIBUTION MADE EASY

Attribution doesn't need to be in titles. Just include it somewhere accessible:

AUDIO FILES:
• Metadata fields: Producer, Composer, Comment
• Example: Producer: "Radio Tom" + Comment: "Licensed under OML-P"

STREAMING PLATFORMS:
• Use built-in credits features (Spotify Credits, Apple Music)
• Track descriptions
• Example: Add "Radio Tom" to Producer credits

VIDEO CONTENT:
• Video description
• End credits (minimum 3 seconds)
• Example: "Beat by Radio Tom (Licensed under OML-P)"

SOCIAL MEDIA:
• Post caption or first comment
• Example: "Music by Radio Tom | OML-P"

WEBSITES/PODCASTS:
• Credits page or show notes
• Footer attribution
• Example: "Music: Radio Tom - Licensed under OML-P"

The key: Make it findable if someone looks for it. It doesn't need to be 
prominent, just accessible.

===============================================================================

REVENUE THRESHOLD EXPLAINED (OML-P)

What counts toward the $1,000 threshold:
• Streaming royalties (Spotify, Apple Music, etc.)
• YouTube ad revenue
• Song/beat sales
• Show tickets if your music is performed
• Sponsorships related to content using the music
• Crowdfunding (Patreon, Ko-fi, etc.)
• Any other income from projects using the music

What's included:
• If you use the music in MULTIPLE projects, add up ALL revenue
• Rolling 12-month period from first revenue
• Gross revenue (before expenses)

When you hit $1,000:
• You have 30 days to contact creator and get OML-C
• Negotiate payment terms
• Continue your projects without interruption

===============================================================================

PAYMENT OPTIONS (OML-C)

OPTION A: PERCENTAGE ROYALTY
• Pay a percentage of your revenue
• Typical range: 2-10% depending on how much you use the music
• Quarterly reports and payments
• Good for ongoing projects with variable income

OPTION B: FLAT FEE  
• One-time payment for specified use
• Negotiate based on your project and budget
• No ongoing reporting required
• Good for projects with defined scope

OPTION C: HYBRID
• Upfront payment + reduced ongoing royalty
• Example: $1,000 upfront + 3% quarterly
• Combines benefits of both approaches
• Good for larger projects with ongoing revenue

All rates and amounts are negotiated between you and the creator - no rigid 
price lists.

===============================================================================

SYNC LICENSING (OML-S)

WHAT'S INCLUDED:
• Master rights (to use the recording)
• Sync rights (to use the composition)
• Complete clearance in one agreement
• No separate deals needed

SPECIFY YOUR NEEDS:
• Term: How long (perpetual, 1 year, 5 years, etc.)
• Territory: Where (worldwide, US only, etc.)
• Media: What platforms (theatrical, streaming, social, etc.)
• Usage: How featured (main theme, background, credits, etc.)

PAYMENT:
• Flat fee negotiated based on project
• Depends on: budget, scope, prominence, territory, term
• Separate from PRO performance royalties
• Usually paid upfront or 50/50 (execution + before first use)

RESPONSIBILITIES:
• File cue sheets with PROs (ASCAP, BMI, SESAC)
• Provide proper credits
• Stay within licensed scope
• Report usage to creator

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

Q: What's the difference between OML-F and OML-P?
A: OML-F is completely open with no revenue limits - truly free and open source. 
OML-P is free under $1K but requires upgrading to OML-C for commercial use above 
that threshold. OML-F also allows redistribution of stems/samples, OML-P doesn't.

Q: When should I use OML-F vs OML-P?
A: Use OML-F if you want maximum openness and don't need revenue from the music. 
Use OML-P if you want to support small creators for free but get paid when 
projects become commercially successful.

Q: Can I use beats made with Splice under OML?
A: Yes! OML v1.0 is specifically designed to work with sample libraries. You 
license the beat as a finished work, not the underlying samples.

Q: Do I need to put "Licensed under OML-P" in my song title?
A: No! Just put it somewhere accessible like metadata, description, or credits.

Q: What if I make $999 one year and $200 the next?
A: The threshold is per 12-month rolling period. If you make $999 in year 1, 
you're fine. In year 2, it resets - you can make another $1,000 before needing 
OML-C.

Q: Can I negotiate a lower royalty rate for OML-C?
A: Yes! All terms are negotiable between creator and user. The framework 
provides structure, but you agree on specific terms.

Q: What's the difference between OML-C and OML-S?
A: OML-C is for general commercial music use (releases, streams, performances). 
OML-S is specifically for synchronizing music with visual media (film, TV, ads, 
games).

Q: Do I need OML-C AND OML-S?
A: Depends on use. If you're just releasing music commercially, OML-C is 
enough. If you're putting music in a film/ad/game, use OML-S. For a music 
video of your own song, OML-C covers it.

Q: Can I switch between percentage and flat fee later?
A: Only by mutual written agreement. Once you choose a payment structure and 
sign the agreement, it stays unless both parties agree to change it.

Q: What if someone violates the license?
A: License terminates automatically. They must stop using the work. You can 
seek legal remedies. For attribution violations, they get 15 days to cure.

Q: Can I use OML for sample packs?
A: Yes! OML-P and OML-C work great for samples, loops, and one-shots. Just be 
clear about whether you're granting stem access or just the right to use 
samples in projects.

Q: What about remixes and covers?
A: Remixes and derivatives are allowed and covered under OML. Covers (re-
recordings of the composition) aren't addressed - those typically need 
mechanical licenses.
