COMMERCIAL USE LICENSE

Version 1.0 - Effective October 2025
===============================================================================

OVERVIEW

This license allows unlimited commercial use of the musical work in exchange

===============================================================================

"You" or "Licensee" means the person or entity using the Work under this 
license.

"Gross Revenue" means all income received from projects using the Work, 
calculated before any deductions.

"Net Revenue" means Gross Revenue minus directly attributable costs like 
distribution fees, payment processing fees, and platform commissions. General 
business overhead and production costs are NOT deductible.

"Commercial Use" means any revenue-generating use of the Work, without limits.

===============================================================================

  (unless specifically negotiated)

===============================================================================

4. PAYMENT STRUCTURE

Upon executing this license, you and the Creator will agree to ONE of these 
payment structures:

OPTION A: PERCENTAGE-BASED ROYALTY
You pay the Creator a percentage of your Net Revenue. The specific percentage 
is negotiated and specified in the License Execution Agreement below.

Common royalty arrangements:
• Music releases with the Work as primary element: typically 5-10% of Net 
  Revenue
• Background/ambient use: typically 2-5% of Net Revenue
• Derivative works: typically 2-8% of Net Revenue depending on how much of the 
  Work is used

Reporting & Payment:
• Quarterly reports due within 30 days of quarter end (April 30, July 31, 
  October 31, January 31)
• Payment due with report
• Minimum payment threshold: $50 per quarter (if below $50, no payment due 
  that quarter)
• Late payments incur 1.5% monthly interest

OPTION B: FLAT FEE
You pay a one-time fee for specified uses. The amount and scope are negotiated 
based on your intended use.

Fee covers:
• Defined scope of use (specify: project type, duration, territory, media)
• One-time payment with no ongoing royalties
• Can be perpetual or limited term

OPTION C: HYBRID
Upfront payment plus reduced ongoing royalties.

Example structure:
• Upfront fee: [negotiated amount]
• Plus ongoing royalty: [negotiated percentage, typically 50% of standard rate]

===============================================================================

5. ATTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS

You must give credit to the Creator in an accessible location. This can be in:

• Audio file metadata (Producer, Composer, or Comment fields)
• Video description or credits
• Track credits on streaming platforms (Spotify Credits, Apple Music, etc.)
• Album liner notes or digital booklet
• Social media post captions
• Website credits page
• Any other place where your audience can reasonably find it

Minimum attribution format:
"[Work Title] by [Creator Name]" or "prod. by [Creator Name]" or "Beat by 
[Creator Name]"

Include license reference somewhere accessible:
"Licensed under OML-C" or "Licensed under Open Music License"

Examples:
• Audio metadata: Producer: "Radio Tom" + Comment: "Licensed under OML-C"
• Spotify: Add "Radio Tom" to Producer credits
• YouTube: "Music by Radio Tom (Licensed under OML-C)" in description
• Album credits: "Produced by Radio Tom - Licensed under OML-C"

For high-revenue uses (over $50,000), provide prominent attribution in primary 
credits and include links to Creator's profiles when possible.

===============================================================================

6. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS (For Royalty Agreements)

If you selected Option A (Percentage-Based Royalty), you must provide quarterly 
reports including:

• Reporting period dates
• All revenue sources using the Work
• Gross Revenue and Net Revenue calculations
• Documentation of any deductions
• Royalty calculation and amount due
• Payment confirmation

Keep accurate records for 4 years, including:
• Revenue statements from all platforms
• Contracts involving the Work
• Proof of all deductions claimed

The Creator may audit your records once per year with 30 days notice. If 
underpayment exceeds 10%, you pay audit costs plus the deficiency plus 
interest.

===============================================================================

7. UNDERLYING SAMPLES AND THIRD-PARTY CONTENT

Important Note:

If the Creator used samples from libraries like Splice, Loopcloud, or other 
sources:

• You receive rights to use the finished Work as delivered
• You do NOT receive rights to underlying samples or elements
• You cannot extract and redistribute individual samples or stems
• The Work must be used as a complete composition

The Creator warrants they have rights to license the Work to you, but 
underlying samples remain subject to their original licenses.

If you need stems or isolated elements, negotiate this separately with the 
Creator.

===============================================================================

8. DERIVATIVE WORKS

You can create and commercially exploit derivative works using the Work:

• You own your original creative contributions
• The underlying Work remains the Creator's property

• Revenue from derivatives counts toward your payment obligations

If you sublicense derivative works to others:
• Notify Creator within 30 days
• Pay Creator agreed-upon percentage of sublicensing revenue (typically 20-30%)
• Ensure sublicensees provide proper attribution

Attribution for derivatives:
"Contains music by Radio Tom" or "Based on [Work Title] by Radio Tom" or 
"[Song Title] (prod. by Radio Tom)"

If negotiation fails, submit to mediation under AAA rules. Costs split equally.

arbitration under AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules:
• One arbitrator (mutually agreed or selected per AAA rules)

  prevailing party
