# Open Music License (OML)

**A fair, transparent, and enforceable open-source license for music production assets.**

## What is OML?

The Open Music License (OML) is a dual-tier licensing framework designed specifically for music producers, beatmakers, and audio creators who want to share their work openly while maintaining fair compensation for commercial use.

### Perfect For

- Samples and one-shots
- Loops and beats
- Stems and multitracks
- MIDI files and sequences
- Production templates
- Sound design assets

## Why OML?

Traditional open-source licenses (MIT, GPL, Apache) weren't designed for music. Creative Commons licenses lack specific provisions for royalties, sampling rights, and revenue thresholds. OML bridges this gap with:

✅ **Clear Attribution Requirements** - Specific formats for metadata, credits, and promotional materials  
✅ **Fair Revenue Threshold** - Free for personal and small projects under $1,000 annual gross revenue  
✅ **Transparent Commercial Terms** - Reasonable royalty structures for professional use  
✅ **Music-Specific Provisions** - Addresses sampling, stems, derivatives, and sync licensing  
✅ **Legally Enforceable** - Professional language with clear dispute resolution  
✅ **Creator-Friendly** - Protects your work while encouraging collaboration

## Three License Types

### 🆓 OML-Personal (Free Tier)

For hobbyists, students, emerging creators, and small-scale projects:

- Use, modify, and distribute freely
- Monetize up to $1,000 gross revenue per year
- Attribution required in all uses

### 💼 OML-Commercial (Royalty Tier)

For professional releases, sync licensing, and commercial projects:

- Unlimited commercial usage rights
- Fair royalty structures (percentage or flat-fee options)
- Quarterly reporting and payment terms

### 🎬 OML-Sync (Synchronization License)
