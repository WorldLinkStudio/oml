# Plain English Summaries - Open Music License (OML)

## What is OML?

The Open Music License (OML) is like a "fair use" agreement for music creators and users. Think of it as a bridge between completely free music (which doesn't pay creators) and expensive commercial licensing (which can be out of reach for small projects).

OML comes in three flavors:

- **OML-P (Personal)**: Free for small projects
- **OML-C (Commercial)**: Paid licensing for professional use
- **OML-S (Sync)**: Special licensing for film, TV, and video

## OML-P (Personal Use License) - The Free Tier

### In Simple Terms

"This is free for personal projects and small businesses, but if you start making serious money, you need to upgrade to the paid version."

### Who Should Use This?

- Hobbyists and students
- Small YouTube channels
- Independent artists
- Podcasters with small audiences
- Anyone making less than $1,000/year from their project

### What You Can Do

✅ Use the music in your projects  
✅ Modify and remix it  
✅ Share your creations  
✅ Make money (up to $1,000/year total)  
✅ Perform it live

### What You Must Do

📝 Always credit the creator  
📝 Include the license information  
📝 Track your revenue honestly

### What You Cannot Do

❌ Claim you wrote the original music

### The $1,000 Rule Explained

- Count ALL money from ALL projects using the music
- Includes ads, sponsorships, donations, sales, streaming revenue
- Rolling 12-month period (not calendar year)
- If you hit $1,000, you have 30 days to get a commercial license

## OML-C (Commercial Use License) - The Professional Tier

## Attribution - The Credit Requirements

### Why Attribution Matters

Attribution is how you give credit to the music creator. It's like citing sources in a research paper - it's required, respectful, and helps creators get recognition.

### Basic Attribution Format

```text
"[Song Title]" by [Creator Name] (C) [Year] [Creator Name]
Licensed under OML [P/C/S] License
```

### Where to Put Credits

#### For Music Releases

- Album liner notes
- Streaming platform credits
- Press releases
- Social media posts

#### For Videos

- Video description
- End credits (minimum 3-5 seconds)
- Chapter markers
- Pinned comments

#### For Live Performances

- Verbal announcement
- Printed programs
- Event descriptions

#### For Websites

- Same page as the music
- Credits page
- Footer attribution

### Attribution Don'ts

❌ Don't make credits tiny or hard to read  
❌ Don't hide credits in fine print  
❌ Don't abbreviate the creator's name  
❌ Don't forget to include the license info

## Revenue Tracking - The Money Part

### What Counts as Revenue?

**Everything that brings in money:**

- Ad revenue (YouTube, podcasts, websites)
- Sponsorships and partnerships
- Direct sales (merchandise, tickets)
- Streaming royalties
- Crowdfunding (Patreon, Ko-fi)
- Affiliate income
- Licensing fees you receive
- Donations and tips

### What Doesn't Count?

- Personal expenses
- Production costs
- Equipment purchases
- General business overhead

### How to Track It

1. **Keep records** of all income sources
2. **Use accounting software** or spreadsheets
3. **Save receipts** and payment confirmations
4. **Calculate monthly** to stay on top of the $1,000 threshold
5. **Be honest** - this protects both you and the creator

## Derivative Works - Remixing and Sampling

### What Are Derivative Works?

Any new creation that uses the original music:

- Remixes and mashups
- Songs that sample the original
- New arrangements
- Cover versions
- Music videos using the track

### Your Rights

✅ Create derivative works  
✅ Own your original contributions  
✅ Distribute your derivatives  
✅ Make money from your derivatives

### Your Responsibilities

📝 Credit the original creator  
📝 Include "Contains portions of [Original Title] by [Creator]"  
📝 Follow the same license terms  
📝 Pay royalties if using commercially

### Ownership Clarification

- **You own**: Your new creative elements
- **Creator owns**: The original music
- **You both benefit**: From the derivative work
