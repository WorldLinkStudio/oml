6. UNDERLYING SAMPLES AND THIRD-PARTY CONTENT

Important Note About Sample Libraries:

If the Creator used samples from libraries like Splice, Loopcloud, or other 
sources in creating the Work:

• You receive rights to use the finished Work (the beat, composition, or 
  recording as delivered)
• You do NOT receive rights to the underlying samples or elements used to 
  create the Work
• You cannot extract individual samples or stems to use separately
• You cannot redistribute isolated elements from the Work

The Creator represents that they have the necessary rights to license the Work 
to you as a finished composition, but any underlying samples remain subject to 
their original licenses.

If you need access to stems or isolated elements, negotiate this separately 
with the Creator.

===============================================================================
